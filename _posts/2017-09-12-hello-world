Took some time ... but finally, the blog has arrived. The Blog has arrived. :..[ (teardrops)

Now, what do I want to blog about? Well, it is easy. I'd like to provide insights into upcoming projects I'm working on, the knowledge I pick up along the way of getting there, my opinion about certain things around Coding, etc.

I hope to provide valuable posts to others who tackle similar topics or just have a general interest in coding and are looking for something to read up next.

Stick around, cause we are just starting.
